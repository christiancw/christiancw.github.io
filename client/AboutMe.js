        <p>Hello! I am a full stack web developer based in New York.</p>
        <p>I'm in the midst of developing a more robust personal page, but in the meantime, you can check out some of my recent projects below.</p>
        <p>The unifying feature of my studies and my career is an interest in logic.  After finishing my degreee in Philosophy at the University of Chicago, I initially set my sights on a career as a lawyer.  Although I have remained interested in the law, I soon decided against enrolling in law school, and I left my job with a large law firm for an operations role at Axiom. At Axiom, I had the opportunity to help bring change to the legal industry.  I loved building the business and solving the kinds of issues that confront a rapidly growing, disruptive company.  My career there progressed from an operations role in Chicago, to a sales role in San Francisco, to ulitmately working on strategic corporate development team tasked with opening new offices in Continental Europe.</p>
        <p>Although I enjoyed the challenge of helping Axiom scale, I really felt that I wanted to be involved in developing products in my career.  To do that required that I develop some new skills, and so I ended up leaving Axiom in order to pursue software development full time. Currently I am looking for a role here in New York where I can put my skills to use.  If you are at or know of a company that is seeking someone with my background, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
