          <h5>About me (in brief)</h5>
            <p>I'm a philosphy major with a strong interest in logic - an interest that I initially thought would be best served in law school, but which I'm now pursuing in my work as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>In my professional life, I've most recently held roles in operations, practice management, and corporate development at Axiom.</p>
            <p>Although I enjoyed the challenge of helping to scale the company, I knew that I wanted to work with technology products in my career.  Realizing that I would need to develop some new skills for that, I left Axiom in order to pursue software development full time in 2017 and am now seeking opportunities as a technologist in New York.</p>
